# A Small Program for Printing Nifti Header
Author: Chengran Li
## Description 
This project is more for me to practice the usage of nifti_clib library. 

The program will read the nifti file and print the header file to standard output. 

This program use the library developped by members of the NIFTI DFWG and volunteers in the neuroimaging community. see github (https://github.com/NIFTI-Imaging/nifti_clib)
